Installation
============

Hopefully installation is as easy as

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install floky

The floky wheels are only compiled for **Linux** at the moment. Are you on Linux and do you encounter an error? Please
open an `issue <https://github.com/ritchie46/lsh-rs/issues>`_.

If you are on **macOs or Windows**, you can compile from
`source <https://github.com/ritchie46/lsh-rs/>`_. You probably need a Fortran compiler to be able to. If you have
succeeded, please help me add your steps to `travis <https://github.com/ritchie46/lsh-rs/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_
